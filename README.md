A simplified version of a long-running personal project of building a gaming social site, with just a bit of content to learn the new methods.

Requirements:

-There is the main landing page, a page lising reviews, and four review pages.
-The Reviews page has an unordered list of reviews, the Divinity review contains a table of screenshot images.
-The main stylesheet is project0.css.
-Among others, the css porperties float, vertical-align, margin-left, width and height are used. For selectors, element, list of elements, #id, .class, psuedoclass and descendants are used.
-When the screen width drops below 650px the images in the site header are removed to make room
-The 'breadcrumb' bootstrap component is used, and the Divinty review uses multiple columns to arrange the review text and the screenshots.
-Four scss variables are used for colors, scss nesting is used for the #site_head id, and %greytext is inherited.
