        <p>Welcome! We hope you enjoy you stay here on the site, and that you find it a useful tool. We are dedicated to creating a friendly, helpful atmosphere here, so if you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to let us know!</p>
        <p>Thereâ€™s not much to the site right now, something especially sad given the length of time this has been kicking around in my head, but hopefully in the future it will turn into something real. What I want to a social site specifically for gamers of all types, focused of helping people make connections in the local areas. Even if it helps people find what businesses are nearby, or what events are coming up, I want to do my part to foster a sense of community for gamers. This culture has been important to me for a long time, and I want to be more of a part of it, and maybe even help it along.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, I hope SOMETHING comes of it, even if it just turns into a local thing for a small group of people. Like I said, this has been in my head for a while. So whatever happens, lets get going!</p>
