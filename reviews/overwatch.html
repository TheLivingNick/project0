        <h2 id="page_title">Review: Overwatch</h2>
        <p>OK, I feel a little silly doing a review of this one. It’s one of the biggest and most well-known games in the world right now, but it is also one that has eaten up a huge amount of my attention for the last two years, so I have to include it.</p>
        <p>Competitive online multiplayer shooter. Competitive … online … multiplayer … shooter. It STILL feels weird to take about a game in this genre as one of my favorites. Multiplayer-only competitive games, and especially the shooter variety, were something that I avoid more than pretty much any other type of game. I didn’t like gaming with strangers, especially not in a often heated setting. I was a PvE player through and through. I still am actually; Overwatch is the exception, and a great on.</p>
        <p>It was the look, lore and characters of Overwatch that managed to first hook story-obsessed me. Blizzard went full bore in the creation of their new world, even putting out Pixar-quality animated shorts to introduce people to the game. It worked, too. Almost every character in the game has a pretty strong following, and a good backstory and personality to get people to relate to them. You’re never just “hammer-guy” or “rocket-girl”; you always know the context of who you are playing, quite a feat given the limited gameplay.</p>
        <p>The gameplay itself in deceptively deep and very well polished. While it is still a shooter at it’s core, Blizzard made sure there were options for everyone, even those with bad aim (me). Knowing the maps, the strategies, and making sure the team is working together, all can matter more than the ability to flick-shot someone a whole map away (though it does help). I actually spend most of my time playing healing-based classes, and still feel like I am an important part of the team.</p>
        <p>Even if this type of game hasn’t been your cup of tea in the past, wait for a free weekend and give Overwatch a go. At the very least, you’ll know what everyone is talking about.</p>
