        <p>Co-operative card game! About superheroes! Yeah, this was a pretty easy hook for me when some neighbors of mine first introduced it to me. Very fun, no too complicated, and with plenty of heart.</p>
        <p>This game isn’t as well known as some, but those who do know it often love it, and for good reason. Fairly easy to pick, it is also pretty easy to get into. Even for people who haven’t played too much of this kind of game before, the old-school super-hero vibe is great and getting people’s attention and keeping them entertained. Even better, the fact that it is co-operative makes it much easier for veterans to introduce it to new players, since helping them figure everything is literally built into the game.</p>
        <p>The game manages to have a number of different difficulty levels by having a good stable of villains to face off against. Not only does that let the game scale, it also keep the gameplay fresh and interesting. There are even special sets of rules that you can apply to villains to move them up or down the scale of difficulty, pushing things even farther. The variety of heroes matches it, with numerous different play types for the different hero types. Moreover, the different heroes can combo with each other in different ways, so there are almost infinite teams that can be put together to face off against the villain decks.</p>
        <p>Also, there is an environment deck that you will learn to hate, but in a good way.</p>
        <p>Full of personality, with massive replay value, and a lot of fun, this is definitely one to check out. You can get the expansions once you’re hooked.</p>
