        <h2 id="page_title">Review: Horizon Zero Dawn</h2>
        <p>Despite the massive number of open-world games that have come out in recent years, this game manages to stand out above them. Even if you are tired of the genre, you are doing yourself a great disservice if you don’t give this one a try.</p>
        <p>Where to begin? Well, for one, its gorgeous. It uses the power of the PS4 to its maximum, and the results are fantastic. The valley that you live in and travel through has an array of different environments, from deep forests to snowy mountains to windswept deserts, and each manages to feel alive. The tribal ascetic of the characters is very well handled, well extrapolated without feeling overdone. It draws both from actual tribal designs of the past and mixes them well with the strange future that these tribes have developed in.</p>
        <p>The “strange future” aspect of the game gives it a lot of its strength. While you will be fighting humans fairly often most of the enemies you face will be the oddly-animalistic robot that fill the valley. Aside from just having interesting character models, they really do behave like animals in many ways; moving as herds, panicking when threatened, even grazing on the various landscapes and plant-life. The juxtaposition of the high-tech and the feral is very intriguing, and extremely fun to play against.</p>
        <p>The story of the game is complex, and I don’t want to spoil any of it, but it follows the journey of Aloy, a young woman who is forced to seek out the secrets of her past, and forced in turn to discover the secrets if how this world came to be as its history and her own intertwine more and more. The story is solid, the characters are well made, and Aloy herself makes a wonderful protagonist.</p>
        <p>In summary, yeah, I really like this one. Definitely adds value to owning a PS4, and a game that I desperately hope gets a sequel.</p>
