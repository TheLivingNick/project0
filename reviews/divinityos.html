        <h2 id="page_title">Review: Divinity Original Sin</h2>
        <p>This game is done by a professional studio, but was funded mainly through a Kickstarter campaign. People were promised a slower-paced party RPG that harkened back to games of old. And they got it.</p>
        <p>First of all, don't go into this game for a fast-paced, action-filled adrenaline ride. If that’s what you want, look elsewhere. If you are willing to take a chance on a bit of a different game, or miss the likes of Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights, then this is the game for you!</p>
        <p>While technically taking place in the same world as the other Divinity titles, you don’t need to know anything about them to enjoy this game. You’re heroes, you are sent to investigate a crime in a wartorn city, and that’s pretty much all your start will, or need to know in the beginning. After that though … yeah, to say this gets a bit complex would be the cruelest of understatements. But I in no way mean that in a negative way; the depth and complexity of the story and the world is one of the big draws of the game. If is probably the closest you can come to playing a tabletop game in video game form. Fate will be broken, lives lost, great evils found, betrayals unearthed, and plenty of other meaty melodrama.</p>
        <p>Even with winding story, the actual mechanics of the game manage to almost match it. It is easy to get lost in many, many ways you can develop and outfit your character, but it is a refreshing change from the constant simplification that has been happening to other RPGs. You can do everything from the standard weapons training to making your character smelly in order to drive off melee attacker (as well as everyone else). The combat that comes from all that is just as complex, just as adaptable. Bull rushes, war cries, and of course fireballs, all will appear on the field of battle.</p>
        <p>To top it off, it is also pretty clear that the developers has a lot of fun making the game, and it comes across, especially in the writing. Just look and the screenshots I managed to get from my own game.</p>
